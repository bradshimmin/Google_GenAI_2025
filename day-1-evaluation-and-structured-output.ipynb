    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course. In this notebook, you'll learn some techniques for evaluating the output of a language model. As part of the evaluation, you will also use Gemini's structured data capability to produce evaluation results as instances of Python types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This notebook is more code-heavy than the first Day 1 notebook ([Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/)). This notebook is not a prerequisite for days 2 and beyond, so feel free to skip over it, or come back later in the week. If you have not yet tried the [Prompting](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting/) notebook, start there first as it introduces the fundamentals for interacting with LLMs.\n",

       "Based on the document you provided, here's a breakdown of the training process used for Gemini 1.5 Pro:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Model Architecture:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is a **sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) Transformer-based model.** This means it builds upon the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) but incorporates a MoE structure.\n",
       "*   MoE models use a **learned routing function** to direct inputs to a subset of the model's parameters for processing. This allows the model to have a large total parameter count while only activating a portion of those parameters for any given input.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Training Data:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   The model is trained on a **variety of multimodal and multilingual data.**\n",
       "*   The pre-training dataset includes data sourced from many different domains, including **web documents, code, images, audio, and video content.**\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Training Infrastructure:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Gemini 1.5 Pro is trained on **multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators**, distributed across multiple datacenters.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Training Process:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Pre-training:** The model is initially pre-trained on the large, diverse dataset mentioned above.\n",
       "*   **Instruction Tuning:** After pre-training, Gemini 1.5 Pro is fine-tuned on a collection of multimodal data containing paired instructions and appropriate responses.\n",
       "*   **Human Preference Tuning:** Further tuning is performed based on human preference data.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Aspects and Innovations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Long Context Understanding:** A series of significant architecture changes enable long-context understanding of inputs up to 10 million tokens without degrading performance.\n",
       "*   **Efficiency:** Improvements across the entire model stack (architecture, data, optimization, and systems) allow Gemini 1.5 Pro to achieve comparable quality to Gemini 1.0 Ultra while using significantly less training compute and being significantly more efficient to serve.\n",

       "Okay, I can explain the Gemini 1.5 Pro model architecture to you, keeping in mind your civil engineering background. Think of it like designing a complex infrastructure project.\n",
       "\n",
       "**The Big Picture: A System of Systems**\n",
       "\n",
       "Instead of a single, monolithic structure, Gemini 1.5 Pro is built as a \"system of systems.\" It's not just one big neural network; it's a collection of smaller, specialized networks that work together. This is called a \"Mixture of Experts\" (MoE) architecture.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Components:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **The Transformer Backbone:** This is the fundamental building block, like the concrete and steel that form the core of a building. The Transformer is a type of neural network that excels at processing sequences of data (text, audio, video frames). It's good at understanding relationships between different parts of the input. Think of it as the structural framework that holds everything together.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Mixture of Experts (MoE):** This is where the specialization comes in. Instead of having one giant Transformer, you have multiple smaller \"expert\" Transformers. Each expert is trained to be good at a specific type of task or data. It's like having different teams of engineers, each specializing in a different aspect of the project (e.g., structural, geotechnical, environmental).\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Routing Function:** This is the traffic controller, like the system of roads and highways that direct vehicles to their destination. The routing function analyzes the input data and decides which experts are best suited to handle it. It's a learned function, meaning it gets better at routing over time as the model is trained. Only a subset of the experts are activated for any given input, which makes the model more efficient.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it Works (Analogy to a Construction Project):**\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Input:** You have a massive set of blueprints, reports, videos, and audio recordings related to a large infrastructure project. This is the input data.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Routing:** The routing function looks at the input and determines which \"expert\" teams are needed. For example:\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   If there's a section of text describing soil conditions, it might route that to the \"geotechnical expert\" team.\n",
       "    *   If there's a video of a bridge inspection, it might route that to the \"structural expert\" team.\n",
       "    *   If there's a question about environmental impact, it might route that to the \"environmental expert\" team.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Expert Processing:** The selected expert teams process their assigned data using their specialized Transformer networks. They extract relevant information, identify patterns, and make predictions.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Output:** The outputs from the different expert teams are combined to produce the final result. This could be a summary of the project, answers to specific questions, or a plan for future actions.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Advantages of this Architecture:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Scalability:** Like modular construction, MoE allows the model to grow in size and complexity without becoming unwieldy. You can add more experts as needed to handle new types of data or tasks.\n",
       "*   **Efficiency:** By only activating a subset of the experts for each input, the model uses less computational power. It's like only sending the necessary engineers to a particular site, rather than the entire company.\n",
       "*   **Specialization:** Each expert can be trained to be highly proficient in its area of expertise, leading to better overall performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In Summary:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Gemini 1.5 Pro is a sophisticated system that combines the power of Transformers with the efficiency and specialization of a Mixture of Experts architecture. It's designed to handle massive amounts of data from different sources, reason about complex relationships, and provide accurate and relevant outputs. Just like a well-designed infrastructure project, it's built to be scalable, efficient, and effective.\n",

    "You are an expert evaluator. Your task is to evaluate the quality of the responses generated by two AI models. We will provide you with the user input and a pair of AI-generated responses (Response A and Response B). You should first read the user input carefully for analyzing the task, and then evaluate the quality of the responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will first judge responses individually, following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Then you will give step-by-step explanations for your judgment, compare results to declare the winner based on the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps.\n",

    "# Evaluation\n",
    "## Metric Definition\n",
    "You will be assessing question answering quality, which measures the overall quality of the answer to the question in the user prompt. Pay special attention to length constraints, such as in X words or in Y sentences. The instruction for performing a question-answering task is provided in the user prompt. The response should not contain information that is not present in the context (if it is provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Criteria\n",
    "Instruction following: The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the question answering task instructions, satisfying all of the instruction's requirements.\n",
    "Groundedness: The response contains information included only in the context if the context is present in the user prompt. The response does not reference any outside information.\n",
    "Completeness: The response completely answers the question with sufficient detail.\n",
    "Fluent: The response is well-organized and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rating Rubric\n",
    "\"A\": Response A answers the given question as per the criteria better than response B.\n",
    "\"SAME\": Response A and B answers the given question equally well as per the criteria.\n",
    "\"B\": Response B answers the given question as per the criteria better than response A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Steps\n",
    "STEP 1: Analyze Response A based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response A fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.\n",
    "STEP 2: Analyze Response B based on the question answering quality criteria: Determine how well Response B fulfills the user requirements, is grounded in the context, is complete and fluent, and provides assessment according to the criterion.\n",
    "STEP 3: Compare the overall performance of Response A and Response B based on your analyses and assessment.\n",
    "STEP 4: Output your preference of \"A\", \"SAME\" or \"B\" to the pairwise_choice field according to the Rating Rubric.\n",

    "\n",
    "### LLM limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example, LLMs can struggle to count the number of characters in a word (this is a numerical problem, not a language problem), so an LLM evaluator will not be able to accurately evaluate this type of task. There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customising evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behaviour that might be better provided from a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improving confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to improve the confidence of your evaluations is to include a diverse set of evaluators. That is, use the same prompts and outputs, but execute them on different models, like Gemini Flash and Pro, or even across different providers, like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and local models like Gemma or Qwen. This follows the same idea used earlier, where repeating trials to gather multiple \"opinions\" helps to [reduce error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), except by using different models the \"opinions\" will be more diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn more\n",
    "\n",
